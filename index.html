			Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay alive in a time of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very unique criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for tangible opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is less rosy than he figured it would be; and Trevor, a violent dude driven by the opportunity for a cheap high and his next big score. With options at a premium, the crew risks it all in a myriad of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life

			<p class="sub2"> FORT NITE </p>
			<p class="content">
			Players skydive onto a small island, are equipped with an axe and must scavenge for more weapons, while simultaneously avoiding a killer electrical storm. As players are eliminated, the field of play also gets smaller, meaning players are put closer together. Updates regularly flash on screen detailing how another player was killed “X killed Y with a grenade”, adding to the sense of urgency. While the game is free to play, you do need to create an account with Epic Games.To make this easier users can use their Google or Facebook accounts to log in with Epic Games, or users can create a new account. To get the game started and get on board the “Battle Bus”, you will need to download Epic Games. You are randomly assigned an avatar each time you play the game, regardless of your own gender. Gamers can choose what mode they would like to play in, solo, duo mode or in a squad. You can add friends to your squad and play as a team. When you are ready, you can select play to start the game. </p>

		<p class="sub3">MORTAL KOMBAT</p>
			<p class="content">The defining and best-known feature of the Mortal Kombat series is its finishing move system called Fatality. An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit at the end of the fight.The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.</p>
